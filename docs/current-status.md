## Tim Grover Coach ✅ DONE (built this session, not a formal module)

- Tim Grover personality: direct, no sugarcoating, €30k goal as measuring stick
- 3-layer context per message: vault memory (long-term) + live financial data + last 5 messages

## Module 5.0 — Career Agent MVP ✅ DONE

- New integrated dashboard page at `/career`, responsive at desktop and mobile widths
- Deterministic daily scan chooses at most one opportunity above the threshold
- Transparent 100-point score with strengths, gaps and seniority penalty
- Career claims are limited to user-confirmed or document-verified facts
- CV and motivation materials can be exported as DOCX/PDF in memory
- Explicit approval only marks materials ready for manual submission; it performs no external action
- Outreach is copy-only and can be marked sent after the user sends it manually
- Demo vacancies and contact are visibly labelled; knowledge base and live sources are deferred
- Career routes require HTTP Basic auth in production via `CAREER_ACCESS_KEY`

## Next: Module 1.2 — Portfolio / Accounts Tracker

- New DB tables: `portfolio_accounts`, `portfolio_history`
- Bot commands: `/portfolio`, `/accounts`, `/updatebalance <name> <amount>`

## Do Not Touch

- `transactions` table schema — stable, do not alter
- `net_worth_snapshots` table — append-only, do not delete rows
- `app/parser.py` AI prompt — tuned, test before changing
- `Procfile` — Railway uses this exactly as written
